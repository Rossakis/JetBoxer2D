# JetBoxer2D

JetBox2D is both a lightweight 2D engine for creating C# games, based on the Monogame framework (https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame), and a game sample called JetBoxer that showcases its usage.

The JetBox2D engine contains the following:

-Dynamic Input System that supports concurrent input from both gamepad, keyboard, and mouse, via a single InputManager with methods such as GetButtonDown(InputAction). Each InputAction (e.g. ShootRight) is created in such a way that you can map to it Gamepad-Right Trigger, Gamepad-A Button, Keyboard-Space Key, and Mouse-Right Click *at the same time*, meaning that any one of those input types will trigger the ShootRight InputAction.

-Particle System, which you can use to create custom game effects such as explosions or fire trails.

-Physics Colliders, for detecting the collisions between the BaseGameObject entities in the game.

-Objects and States, necessary for creating the base of the game system.

-Custom Extensions, that can be used to ease the development hassle during the production of the game engine. For example, a wrapper class for Monogame's mouse input, called MouseInput, is used by the Input System to help in mouse input handling.
